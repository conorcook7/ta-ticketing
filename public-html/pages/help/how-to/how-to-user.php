        There are three easy steps that you need to follow in order to create
        a new ticket. After creation, these tickets are queued for available teaching
        assistants with the specific course you need help with. One thing to note is
        that your ticket will be taken out of the queue if you leave the site, and
        it will be placed at the end of the queue when you return to the site.
